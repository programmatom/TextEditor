# TextEditor

Yet another text editor? This one goes back to the early 90s when it was written as a replacement for the Macintosh built-in text box, which wasn't up to the demands of code-oriented editing for another application I was working on. After a 15 year hibernation, I dusted it off and updated it for unicode support using Uniscribe and DirectWrite, and added some more scalable data structures as well.

It is structured as a WinForms control. Since it is written mostly in C#, it is eminently hackable.
